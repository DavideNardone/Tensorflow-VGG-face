# Tensorflow-VGG-face
Implement VGG-face by Tensorflow using the pre-trained model from MatConvNet.

From [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/), you can find almost all the effective models in Matlab data format (.mat).

## Pre-requisite
* Python 2.7
* Scipy
* Tensorflow
* Pre-trained model [vgg-face.mat](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/vgg-face.mat)
